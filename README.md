## MPDL duplicate detection with ALEPH

The provided script enables specific duplicate detection as well for unique and multiple results from a matching routine within ALEPH by use of p_manage_36. It is applicable for MAB formatted bibliographical metadata (here: field 078e for matching) and could be adapted for different formats as well. The respective library in use as well as discriminatory variables are declared in the first code block of the script. Furthermore, the local existence of the MPDL mar.seq-print.csh script to address the p_print_03 method of ALPEH is a prerequisite for using this script.
